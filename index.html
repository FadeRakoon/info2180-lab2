                Am I an Imposter?<br>
                Imposter Syndrome by definition refers to a psychological phenomenon in which individuals doubt their legitimate accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud even though they are legitimately competent. For me this has mostly appeared through a nagging feeling in the back of my mind after seeing the accomplishments of others my age at similar stages in life. One might ask "why?", what reason is there to feel this way when you are well aware of your skills and experience. To that i say, honestly im not quite sure. Maybe it simply a part of life that most people experience in one form or another.

                Growing up I was effortlessly top of my class, something i would come to consider a fact of life. Yet when highschool rolled around suddenly my effortless cruise didnt work, effort was required to progress; effort I would soon realise I had no experience applying to academics. My experiences in highschool taught me to study. Then university began, I knew how to study and I got good grades yet here I am wondering
                "Am I an Imposter?".

                I've had a deepseated interst in Engineering, Software Engineering and Electronics for much of my life. In my penultimate year of highschool, I was invited to participate in a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) Robotics team with my friends. In short, each year FIRST creates a game that teams spend around 6 months building a robot to participate in. The game contains various obstacles as well as different ways to score points throughout the 3 phases of the game. The 2 years spent participating in the sport were arguably my favourite part of highschool. From the late nights building and programming our robot to the amazing people i met along the way the experience truly was a blessing.

                When I began me tertiary education journey at UWI Mona in September of 2024 my love of coding and Robotics led me to my choice of a Computer Science major with a minor in Electronics. I also opted to work with the robotics team from my alma mater as a Coach to help continue the legacy we had started. Through my time being a team member and now a coach my awareness of how others think or approach a problem differently has grown significantly.
